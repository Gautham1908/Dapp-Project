# Dapp-Project
A decentralized application (dApp) is a software application that runs on a blockchain network. Unlike traditional applications that run on a centralized server, dApps are distributed across a network of computers that are interconnected via a blockchain. This makes dApps more secure, transparent, and resistant to censorship or downtime.


Lottery Dapp :

A Dapp lottery contract is a decentralized application built on a blockchain network, which allows users to participate in a lottery with transparent and auditable rules. The following is a high-level description of a typical Dapp lottery contract:

1.Contract Deployment: The contract is deployed on a blockchain network, and its source code is publicly available for anyone to verify.

2.Lottery Creation: The lottery organizer creates a new lottery by specifying the lottery parameters, such as the ticket price, the number of tickets available, the lottery end date, and the prize distribution scheme.

3.Ticket Purchase: Anyone can purchase tickets by sending the required amount of cryptocurrency to the lottery contract address. Each ticket purchase generates a unique ticket ID.

4.Lottery Drawing: Once the lottery end date is reached, the contract randomly selects a winning ticket ID, and the prize is distributed to the ticket owner.

5.Prize Distribution: The prize distribution scheme is defined in the lottery parameters. It can be a simple winner-takes-all scheme, where the entire prize pool goes to the winning ticket owner, or it can be a multi-tiered scheme, where the prize is distributed among multiple winners.

6.Contract Governance: The contract may have a set of rules for contract governance, such as the maximum number of tickets per address, the minimum and maximum ticket price, and the lottery frequency.

7.Transparency and Auditability: The contract is transparent and auditable since all the lottery parameters, ticket purchases, and prize distributions are recorded on the blockchain network and can be publicly verified.

Vending Machine Dapp :

A decentralized application (dapp) vending machine contract is a smart contract that is designed to manage a vending machine on a blockchain network. The vending machine contract allows users to purchase items from the machine using cryptocurrency such as Ethereum or other tokens.

The contract includes the following functions:

1.Register Item: The vending machine owner can register an item in the contract by specifying the item name, item price, and item quantity.

2.Check Item: The users can check the item details such as name, price, and quantity before purchasing the item.

3.Purchase Item: The users can purchase the item using cryptocurrency by sending the required amount of tokens to the vending machine contract. The contract will then deduct the token amount and dispense the item to the user.

4.Refund Item: In case the vending machine fails to dispense the item, or the user changes their mind, they can request a refund by sending a refund request to the contract. The contract will then refund the tokens to the user.

5.Withdraw Tokens: The vending machine owner can withdraw the tokens earned from the vending machine sales by sending a request to the contract. The contract will then transfer the tokens to the owner's account.

The vending machine contract uses a decentralized network, which means that it operates without a central authority. This allows for secure and transparent transactions without the need for intermediaries. Additionally, the vending machine contract can be easily integrated with other dapps and blockchain platforms, making it a versatile and efficient solution for vending machine management.
